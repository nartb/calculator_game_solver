# Calculator, The Game, The Solution

A quick bruteforce solver for a popular mobile game (http://www.simplemachine.co/game/calculator-the-game/).

Upon running solver.py, prompts to the user are used to input the parameters of a particular round before the solution sequence is printed.

The names of actions can be found in actions.py

Pretty straightforward, but just wanted to play with a quick solution to the game.
